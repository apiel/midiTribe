- modulation

- have generic rythmic that can be edited (instead of what is called arp)
    and then create a real arp

- drum pattern (using sample?)
    - key will select pattern
    - there should be a pot to set starting point for key selection by default 0 to 25 but could start at 75 to 100...
    - key can also select drum sound
    - the same as for pattern, a pot should be able to select starting point

- poly drum with AudioPlayMemory -> IO_DrumMachineMem

- mode filter that can change filter from the 4 voice

- should all the / 127.0f be / 128.0f ?

- display waveform as default view

- could use combination of the 4 synth to create a new synth by saving in a wavetable?

- should there be a polyphonic synth?
